# Annoying issues with Windows that I'd like to solve

- Cannot RDP to my laptop from my desktop after the initial RDP session disconnects. Works again after a restart.
- USB devices do not work after they are unplugged, until after a restart.
  - UPDATE: I found that if I plug in the USB devices *before* plugging in the power, the USB devices generally work as expected.
